description: How to configure Esix ORM.
title: Configuration
---

To make it easy to add Esix to your project and to be able to change your application's configuration between your local, test, and production environment, Esix is configured with environment variables.

## Connecting to the Database

These options define how Esix will connect to your database.

`DB_ADAPTER`

The adapter is used to handle the MongoDB connection. Can be either `default` or `mock` where `default` uses the [offical MongoDB package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) and `mock` uses [mongo-mock](https://github.com/williamkapke/mongo-mock) which is great for testing.

`DB_URL`

The URL of the database. Defaults to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.

`DB_POOL_SIZE`

The size of the connection pool. Defaults to `10`.

`DB_DATABASE`

The name of the database to connect to. Defaults to ``.

If you want to create a configuration file for your local environment you can use the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) but you should make sure you don't commit any secrets to GitHub.
