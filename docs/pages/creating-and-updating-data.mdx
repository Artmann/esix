import { ExampleComponent } from '../doc-gen/site/example.tsx'
import { Header } from '../doc-gen/site/header.js'

When it comes to adding new models to the database, there are two different ways to go about it. You can either use
the `create` method and pass it the attributes you want the model to have.

<ExampleComponent name='create' />

Esix models are just normal TypeScript classes, so you can create a new instance of the model and call the `save` method on it.

<ExampleComponent name='create-pojo' />

<Header as='h3' title='Ids' />

When you create a new instance of a model, we'll automatically generate an [ObjectId](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/)
for you and assign it to the `id` property. If you already have an ID you want to use, you can pass it to the `create` method.

MongoDB normally uses the `_id` property for documents, Esix does as well but we've aliased it to `id` for convenience.

<Header as='h3' title='Timestamps' />

When creating a new model, the `createdAt` property will be filled with the current timestamp if it's not present.

When you call `save` on an already existing model, the `updatedAt` field will be filled with the current timestamp.

Both the timestamp properties contain the current time in milliseconds since January 1st, 1970, using JavaScript's
[Date.now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now) method.
