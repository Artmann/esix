Esix is the most productive way to interact with your Mongo Database in TypeScript. ðŸš€

Inspired by ActiveRecord and Eloquent, you define models as normal Typescript classes and these classes are used to query your database.

<Header title='Install Esix' />

Add the package using your favorite package manager.

**Yarn**

<Code lang='shell'>
yarn add esix mongodb
</Code>

**NPM**

```sh
npm install esix mongodb

```

<Header title='Exploring Data' />

First off, you'll need to create a class for your model. This class will extend the `BaseModel` class provided by Esix.

```ts
import { BaseModel } from 'esix'

export default class Book extends BaseModel {
  public isbn = ''
  public title = ''
}

```

The base model comes with id and timestamp fields so you don't have to worry about those things.

Let's continue and create some data!

```ts
import Book from './book.js'

async function createBooks(): Promise<void> {
  await Book.create({
    isbn: '978-0525536291',
    title: 'The Vanishing Half'
  })

  await Book.create({
    isbn: '978-0525521143',
    title: 'The Glass Hotel'
  })
}

```

Now that we have a couple of books in our database, we can query them using the same model class.

```ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express'

import Book from './book'

async function showBook(request: Request, response: Response): Promise<void> {
  const book = await Book.find(request.params.id)

  response.json({
    book
  })
}

```
