# Welcome to Esix Documentation

Esix is a TypeScript database library for MongoDB, heavily inspired by Laravel's Eloquent. Models map to documents in the database, and the QueryBuilder is used to select which documents to retrieve.

## Features

- **Convention over Configuration**: Define your models as normal TypeScript classes with minimal boilerplate
- **Type Safety**: Advanced TypeScript features provide compile-time type safety
- **Fluent Interface**: Chainable query methods for intuitive database operations
- **MongoDB Integration**: Built specifically for MongoDB with support for modern features
- **Aggregation Support**: Built-in aggregation functions for common operations

## Quick Start

Get started with Esix by following our [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) to install and configure Esix in your project.
